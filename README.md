## Exercise 1:

- Caculate the series of term:
```
1/2 + 2/3 + 3/4 + 4/5 + ... + n/(n+1)
```
## Exercise 2: 

- Purpose of the program is to calculate the square root sum of a series of numbers starting from a given value `n` down to 1

## Exercise 3:
- Caculate the series of term:
```
1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + ... + 1/n
```

## Exercise 4:

- Caculate the series of term:
```
1/2 + 1/4 + 1/6 + ... + 1/(2n)
```
## Exercise 5:
- Caculate the series of term:

```
1 / (1 * 2) + 1 / (2 * 3) + 1 / (3 * 4) + ... + 1 / (n * (n + 1))
```
